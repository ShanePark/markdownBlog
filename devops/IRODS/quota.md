That's it. but it never work until you put 

> cu (calulate usage (for quotas))

```bash
iadmin cu
```

it looks nothing, but after uploading file you have to do this otherwise it never knows your quota is exceed.

### The error message from jargon

and there was no delay after changing Quota.

I just changed the quota generously, tried again and it worked immediately. but still in some cases it didn't work so I had to put

```bash
iadmin cu
```

 but anyway iRODS do it periodically itself i guess so if you want to make it strict you sould run the command all the time before delete/upload file or you can rely on auto caculate. it is kinda trade-off.
